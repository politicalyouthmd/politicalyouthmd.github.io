    <h2>Juvenile Curfew Ordinance</h2>
    <p>The ordinance makes it unlawful for any person under the age of 17 to linger, stay, congregate, move about, wander or stroll in any public place in Miami-Dade County, either on foot or in a vehicle during curfew hours. It is the responsibility of parents and legal guardians to ensure their children comply with the curfew.
    <p>What are the curfew hours?</p>
    <p>From Sunday night to Friday morning, the curfew applies between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. From Friday evening to Sunday morning, the curfew applies between midnight and 6 a.m.</p>
    <p>A juvenile under the age of 17 is legitimately exempted from the restrictions of the Miami-Dade County Juvenile Curfew Ordinance if the juvenile:</p>
    <ul>Is accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, or by someone 21 years of age or older who has permission to be responsible for the juvenile</ul>
    <ul>Is working, or traveling to or from work</ul>
    <ul>Is traveling interstate</ul>
    <ul>Has written permission from a parent or guardian to run an errand</ul>
    <ul>Is aiding or assisting in an emergency</ul>
    <ul>Is traveling to or from a school, religious, civic or county-sponsored event</ul>
    <ul>Is emancipated by marriage or court order</ul>
    <ul>Is homeless</ul>
    <ul>Is exercising First Amendment rights</ul>
    <ul>Is on the property of his/her residence, or a neighbor's residence if the neighbor does not object</ul>
    <ul>Is attending or returning from a public event which began before 10 p.m. and has written permission</ul>
    <ul>Is authorized by the County Commission</ul>
    <p>What happens when a juvenile does not comply with the ordinance?</p>
    <p>A law enforcement officer shall stop the apparent juvenile and ask their age, reason for being out during curfew hours, and verify that information with their parent or legal guardian. If out without cause, the juvenile will be taken into custody and transported home, to a police station or other appropriate holding facility where a curfew violation citation will be issued and a parent or guardian notified. If the juvenile is cited three or more times for not complying with the ordinance, the parent or legal guardian of the juvenile will receive a notice to appear and may be punished by a fine of up to $500.</p>
    <h2>Nuisance Abatement</h2>
    <p>Miami-Dade County enacted the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance (NAO), No. 92-42, requiring property and business owners to eliminate public nuisances. The NAO provides the community a tool to encourage owners to take responsibility for preventing recurring nuisance activities on their property in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.</p>
    <p>The NAO addresses recurring criminal/nuisance activity involving:</p>
    <ul>The unlawful sale, delivery or possession of controlled substances/narcotics.</ul>
    <ul>Youth and street gang criminal activity.</ul>
    <ul>Prostitution or solicitation of prostitution.</ul>
    <ul>Lewd and lascivious activity.</ul>
    <ul>The illegal sale, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverages.</ul>
    <ul>Other criminal activities that are a danger to the public health, safety and welfare.</ul>
    <p>Private nuisances involving neighbor disputes are not addressed by the NAO. This includes:</p>
    <ul>Noise</ul>
    <ul>Barking dogs</ul>
    <ul>Loud music</ul>
    <ul>Code enforcement</ul>
    <ul>Other non-criminal activity</ul>
    <p>While these and other activities may be a community problem, they are not addressed by the NAO, but may be addressed through other Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) or Miami-Dade County entities. Call 311 to find out the best course of action.</p>
    <h2>Lauren Book Child Safety Ordinance</h2>
    <p>The Lauren Book Child Safety Ordinance made it against the law for a sexual predator to live within 2,500 feet of any school.
    Miami-Dade County provides a 2,500-Foot Address Compliance Map that displays sexual predators in the area, as  well as schools, parks and day care centers.
    The information shown in the map is received from multiple sources. Miami-Dade County does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or timeliness of the information displayed. The map should only be used as a guide.</p>

    <h2>Date Rape</h2>
    <p>We want to trust the people in our lives: our friends, family members and community acquaintances. Unfortunately, the truth is that we are more likely to be sexually assaulted by someone we know: a friend, a relative, an employer, a date or someone we have recently met than by a stranger.
    Acquaintance rape occurs when someone you know uses physical strength, emotional bargaining, bullying, threats, blackmail, alcohol, drugs or mind games to force you to have sex. If you do not consent freely, and someone has sexual contact with you anyway, it is a crime.
    There are many different types of acquaintance rape. Date rape is one of the most confusing kinds. Some men believe that spending money on women creates a situation where dates owe them sex. Some men also believe that women play hard to get and say "no" but really mean "yes," and that women will be shy to tell anyone what happened.
    Because some men perceive that sex is their right, many women are raped by the men they are dating. It is not simply a lack of communication or a result of lack of control. Rape is an act of violence and of power which is often planned.
    Sexual assault is NEVER the victim's fault. It is the responsibility of the person who committed the act of violence.
    Women are most at risk for rape between ages 16 and 24. Since this is when young women begin to date, they are particularly vulnerable to being a victim of date rape.</p>
    <p>What Do Victims Feel?</p>
    <p>Common Reactions to Victimization</p>
    <p>Victims of date rape may experience many different feelings in response to their crisis. Victims may be confused about whether to tell the police, their school and their family and friends. Some common feelings include:</p>
    <ul>Confusion</ul>
    <ul>Self-blame</ul>
    <ul>Embarrassment</ul>
    <ul>Helplessness</ul>
    <ul>Denial</ul>
    <ul>Shock</ul>
    <ul>Fear</ul>
    <ul>Disbelief</ul>
    <ul>Anger</ul>
    <p>Victims sometimes want to forget that this happened to them. But surviving sexual assault creates many long-term effects. Some common problems are:</p>
    <ul>Nightmares or problems sleeping</ul>
    <ul>Memories about the violence</ul>
    <ul>Depression</ul>
    <ul>Drugs and alcohol used to calm down or forget</ul>
    <ul>Eating disorders</ul>
    <ul>Suicidal thoughts</ul>
    <ul>Trouble concentrating</ul>
    <ul>Health problems</ul>
    <ul>Trust issues in relationships</ul>
    <ul>Flashbacks</ul>
    <p>Victims deserve the help of a rape crisis advocate to help them cope with their feelings and decisions.</p>
    <p>Reaching Out</p>
    <p>Know that it wasn't your fault and you're not to blame.</p>
    <p>Understand that forced sex is never acceptable; it is against the law.</p>
    It is always your right to say "no," and unless you specifically said "yes," you did not give consent.</p>
    <p>You can report sexual assault to law enforcement, even if you knew the perpetrator. You may be able to receive an order for protection to keep the perpetrator away from you
    <p>You deserve medical attention to make sure you are safe from internal injuries, sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy. Your medical provider may also be able to gather evidence in case you want to report the crime.
    If you believe you may have been drugged, you can discuss with your hospital provider having a urine test within the first three days to detect the presence of a date rape drug.</p>
    <p>Free supportive services are available in your community. You can talk to counselors in person or on a hotline, join a support group, get information or get help handling problems that are happening in your life because of the attack.
    Know that you don't have to go through it alone. There are understanding people who will believe you and will support you as you recover. They can also help your family and friends understand what you are going through.</p>
    <p>Safety Tips for Both Women and Men That Help Reduce the Risk of Date Rape</p>
    <p>Be aware, stay alert and pay attention to anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
    <p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>
    <ul>What is going on around you? </ul>
    <ul>Are you uncomfortable?</ul>
    <ul>Did your date lock the door?</ul>
    <ul>Is your date drunk or out of control?</ul>
    <ul>Is the party getting too wild?</ul>
    <p>Trust your gut instinct. If you sense danger, react immediately and get away. Make up any excuse to get out of the situation.
    Make your own plans for transportation. Even if you ride with someone, always have a backup plan for getting home or money for a taxi. Make sure that someone knows where you are going and when you expect to be home.
    Be cautious with drugs and alcohol. It is almost impossible to see danger coming when you are drunk and it is equally hard to fight.</p>
    <p>Be informed about roofies. Don't accept drinks from acquaintances or strangers. Don't leave your drink unattended. Always have trusted friends watch out for you so if you feel sick or drunk, your trusted friends can help you home.
    Never stay overnight at a party. Take a taxi home if need be, but don't crash out drunk in a room at a party or friend's house.</p>
    <p>Remember, Date Rape is a crime.</p> <p>Forcing sex is a violent crime, not a sexual act. Every person has a right to set their own limits or change their mind-each individual maintains the right to decide what happens to their own body.
    Don't justify rape with sexist beliefs. Often victims are accused of causing their own rape by dressing sexy, drinking alcohol, walking or partying alone, or agreeing to be alone with a man. None of these actions are criminal acts; these acts never justify rape.</p> Rape is a violent act that uses sex as a weapon to exert power over someone and humiliate or violate someone.
    Err on the side of safety and stop at "no." If someone says "no" verbally or appears distressed, scared, uncomfortable, cries, pleads or begs, you need to stop! Forcing sex without consent is rape.
    Always get full informed consent. Don't take advantage of someone who is drunk, passed out or high, underage or otherwise mentally or physically unable to clearly verbalize or communicate this is what he or she wants.
    Be cautious with drugs and alcohol. Don't ever use being drunk as an excuse for rape. Be aware that when you are drunk or high it is harder to be in control and think clearly-particularly in a group situation.
  <h2>Living Wage Ordinance</h2>
    <p>What is a Living Wage?</p>
    <p>A living wage refers to the wage level it would take to meet regular living standards for a given area. It is included in the calculation may vary, however, depending on who you ask.</p>
    <p>For example, basic needs—things like shelter, clothing, and food—are always included. Often, things like medical expenses, transportation, and child care are also a part of the basic calculation.</p> <p>But, which exact expenses are used and how they are tallied may vary. Things like entertainment, communication costs, and debt repayments—though a normal part of living expenses for most of us—are often left out.</p>
    <p>Once expense inclusions are decided, the living wage is usually calculated for each family size.<p> <p>For example, it costs less to feed and house an individual than it does a family of five, and this needs to be taken into account in the results.</p>
    <p>The idea behind calculating a living wage is that it opens the discussion for what appropriate minimum wages should be. In some states and municipalities, the living wage has become the basis for living wage ordinances or living wage laws which, in effect, become minimum wage laws for that area.</p>
    <p>This is important because federal and even state minimum wages may not be sufficient to pay for typical living expenses in all areas, especially since our federal minimum wage is not currently tied to inflation or cost-of-living changes. In areas where the minimum wage is not enough to pay for basic living costs, employees who are working for minimum wage and who do not rely on government assistance programs will have greater hurdles to make a living. For employers, this can mean greater turnover if employees are constantly seeking ways to make more money.</p>
