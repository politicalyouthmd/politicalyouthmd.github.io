    <p style="text-align:center; ">Ordinances are county-wide legislation. They set local policy and can vary widely across an area. Below are some ordinances currently enacted in Miami-Dade.</p>
    <button class="accordion">Juvenile Curfew Ordinance</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>The ordinance makes it unlawful for any person under the age of 17 to linger, stay, congregate, move about, wander or stroll in any public place in Miami-Dade County, either on foot or in a vehicle during curfew hours.</p>
    <p>From Sunday night to Friday morning, the curfew lasts from 11 PM to 6 AM. From Friday evening to Sunday morning, the curfew lasts between midnight and 6 AM</p>
    <br />
    <ol>Exceptions:</ol>
    <li>Is accompanied by a legal guardian, or by someone 21 years of age or older with permission from the child's guardian</li>
    <li>Is working or in transit to or from work</li>
    <li>Is traveling interstate</li>
    <li>Has written permission from a guardian</li>
    <li>Is aiding or assisting in an emergency</li>
    <li>Is traveling to or from a school, religious, civic or county-sponsored event</li>
    <li>Is legally emancipated</li>
    <li>Is homeless</li>
    <li>Is exercising First Amendment rights</li>

    <li>Is attending/returning from a public event which began before 10 p.m. and has written permission</li>
    <li>Is authorized by the County Commission</li>
    <br />
    <p>If someone is found to be breaking the curfew, an officer will stop them, ask their age, why they are out, and then verify their answers with their guardian. If they don't have "cause" to be out, they will be taken home, to the police station, or "an appropriate holding facility".</p>
    <p>If someone is written up three or more times for breaking curfew, their guardian will receive a notice to appear and be punished with a fine of at most $500.</p>
